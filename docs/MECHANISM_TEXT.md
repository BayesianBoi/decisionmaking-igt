# 4.1 Interpretation of Forgetting Mechanisms
(Recommended Placement: Discussion Section 4.1)

Our finding that substance users exhibit significantly higher forgetting rates ($\lambda$) than controls provides a mechanistic explanation for their IGT performance. To illustrate the behavioral impact of this parameter, we simulated choice behavior for two generative agents exposed to the standard IGT payoff structure (Figure 3).

The "Retention Agent" ($\lambda=0.1$, representing healthy controls) effectively integrates the infrequent large losses from Deck B into a stable negative value estimate. As shown in **Figure 3**, the probability of choosing Deck B drops rapidly and remains low, as the negative value persists in memory.

In contrast, the "Decay Agent" ($\lambda=0.6$, representing substance users) displays a pathological pattern of "punishment-dependent switching." While the agent initially reacts to losses by reducing its choice probability (demonstrating intact outcome sensitivity), this avoidance is transient. In the absence of sustained reinforcement, the negative value signal decays, causing the frequent gains to reassert their influence. Consequently, the probability of choosing Deck B drifts back up to chance levels within 10-20 trials of a loss. This simulation demonstrates that memory decay alone is sufficient to produce the failure to sustain advantageous behavior observed in substance use disorders, without invoking deficits in learning rate or exploration.

The Decay Agent (orange) shows transient avoidance following losses (dips) but fails to sustain this preference due to value degradation.*
